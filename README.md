# Ai Assistant
A voice assistant using OpenAI's GPT-3 API and Google's text-to-speech. Built in two hours just for fun. If you want to use this, you'll need to get an API key from OpenAI. You can get one [here](https://beta.openai.com/).

Feel free to use this code for whatever you want. If you do, please give me credit.
